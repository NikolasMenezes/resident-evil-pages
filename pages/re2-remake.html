                        Resident Evil 2 Remake (RE2R) is a reimagined version of the classic Resident Evil 2, released
                        in 2019. The story is set in September 1998, during the T-virus outbreak in Raccoon City, much
                        like RE3R, but from the perspective of different characters. The game follows Leon S. Kennedy, a
                        rookie cop on his first day, and Claire Redfield, a college student searching for her brother,
                        Chris Redfield. Both are thrown into the chaos of the city overrun by zombies and other
                        bio-weapons created by the Umbrella Corporation.

                    <p>
                        The story unfolds as Leon and Claire fight to survive and uncover the truth behind the viral
                        outbreak. Along the way, they encounter Ada Wong, a mysterious woman with unclear motives who
                        becomes intertwined in Leon’s story. The remake offers a modernized gameplay experience, adding
                        tension and horror to the narrative as the characters try to escape the city and face terrifying
                        enemies like Mr. X, an unrelenting bio-weapon designed to eliminate survivors.

                        The story escalates as Leon and Ashley fight to survive, confront Saddler, and search for a way
                        to cure themselves of the parasite. Leon eventually defeats Saddler in a climactic battle with
                        the help of his mysterious ally, Ada Wong, and successfully escapes with Ashley, stopping the
                        cult’s plan to spread the parasite globally.

                        <p>
                            Claire is a college student searching for her brother, Chris Redfield, a member of the
                            S.T.A.R.S. team from the first Resident Evil. In her search, she gets caught in the Raccoon
                            City outbreak, and her focus quickly shifts to survival and protecting others. Claire is
                            resourceful and brave, demonstrating strong maternal instincts, particularly in her bond
                            with Sherry Birkin, a young girl she encounters during the events of RE2R. Her determination
                            to find her brother and protect Sherry from the dangers of the city makes her one of the
                            franchise’s strongest female characters.

                        <p>
                            Leon is a rookie cop who arrives in Raccoon City on his first day as a police officer, only
                            to be met with a full-scale outbreak of zombies and chaos. Despite being inexperienced, Leon
                            quickly adapts and shows incredible courage and resilience as he fights for survival.
                            Throughout RE2R, Leon’s natural sense of justice and duty shine through as he strives to
                            save survivors and uncover the truth about the Umbrella Corporation's involvement in the
                            outbreak. His journey is further complicated by his encounters with Ada Wong, which test his
                            trust and judgment.

                        <h2 class="title">Ada Wong</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ada is an enigmatic and resourceful woman who crosses paths with Leon multiple times
                            throughout RE2R. She presents herself as a FBI agent working to stop Umbrella, but her true
                            motives remain unclear, and she’s often involved in morally ambiguous situations. Ada’s
                            interactions with Leon are marked by a mixture of cooperation, flirtation, and deception,
                            leaving him questioning her true intentions. She’s a skilled spy, using her wits and
                            technology to achieve her objectives while keeping her personal agenda secret. Ada's
                            character adds complexity to the story, as Leon must decide whether to trust her or not.
