                        In the Resident Evil 4 remake, the story follows Leon S. Kennedy, a U.S. government agent, on a
                        mission to rescue the president’s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a sinister
                        cult called Los Illuminados. The cult has taken her to a remote European village, where the
                        inhabitants have been infected by a parasitic organism known as Las Plagas, which allows the
                        cult leader, Osmund Saddler, to control them.

                    <p>
                        As Leon ventures through the village, a castle, and eventually an island, he faces relentless
                        enemies, including mutated creatures, fanatical cultists, and powerful foes like the village
                        chief Bitores Mendez, the castle's castellan Ramon Salazar, and his former comrade, Jack
                        Krauser. Along the way, Leon finds and rescues Ashley but discovers that both of them have been
                        infected with the same parasite.

                        The story escalates as Leon and Ashley fight to survive, confront Saddler, and search for a way
                        to cure themselves of the parasite. Leon eventually defeats Saddler in a climactic battle with
                        the help of his mysterious ally, Ada Wong, and successfully escapes with Ashley, stopping the
                        cult’s plan to spread the parasite globally.
