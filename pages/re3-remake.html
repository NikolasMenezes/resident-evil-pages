                        Resident Evil 3 Remake (RE3R) is a reimagined version of the classic Resident Evil 3: Nemesis,
                        released in 2020. The story takes place in September 1998 during a biological outbreak in
                        Raccoon City, caused by the leak of the T-virus, a bio-weapon created by the Umbrella
                        Corporation.

                        The protagonist, Jill Valentine, is a former member of the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and
                        Rescue Service) and one of the few survivors of the Spencer Mansion incident from the first
                        game. In RE3R, Jill tries to escape the city while being hunted by a new Umbrella bio-weapon:
                        Nemesis, a gigantic and relentless creature designed to eliminate S.T.A.R.S. members.

                        Amid the chaos, Jill teams up with Carlos Oliveira, a mercenary from the Umbrella Biohazard
                        Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.), sent to the city to rescue survivors. Although Umbrella is
                        responsible for the disaster, Carlos shows integrity by helping Jill, even as he uncovers the
                        darker truths behind his mission.

                            Carlos is a soldier in the U.B.C.S., with advanced combat abilities and a noble heart.
                            Although he works for Umbrella, he quickly finds himself conflicted by the corporation’s
                            actions and the consequences they cause. Throughout RE3R, Carlos aids Jill in several
                            situations, showing a more lighthearted and playful personality, but one that is dedicated
                            to helping innocent people and ending the zombie threat. He proves his bravery, especially
                            when risking his life to save Raccoon City.

                        <p>
                            Jill is one of the most iconic characters in the Resident Evil franchise. As a former
                            S.T.A.R.S. agent, she possesses strong combat and investigative skills. Brave and resilient,
                            Jill showcases intelligence and determination as she navigates the zombie apocalypse. In
                            RE3R’s story, she is a key figure in the fight to expose Umbrella's crimes and survive
                            Nemesis’s relentless pursuit. Despite being hunted, Jill stands firm against the
                            corporation's corruption and the horrors she faces.

                        <p>
                            Nemesis is a bio-weapon created by Umbrella, designed to eliminate S.T.A.R.S. members, and
                            serves as the primary antagonist in RE3R. He is an evolution of the Tyrant, another
                            bio-weapon, but with enhanced intelligence and more devastating abilities. Throughout the
                            game, Nemesis relentlessly pursues Jill, appearing at critical moments and evolving into
                            more grotesque forms as the confrontation progresses. His relentlessness and power make him
                            one of the most feared creatures in the Resident Evil franchise.
