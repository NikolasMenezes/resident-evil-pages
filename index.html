                        The Resident Evil franchise, also known as Biohazard in Japan, is a renowned multimedia series
                        that originated as a survival horror video game in 1996, created by Capcom. The franchise is
                        celebrated for popularizing the survival horror genre in video gaming, featuring a blend of
                        atmospheric tension, puzzle-solving, resource management, and combat against zombies and other
                        bioengineered creatures.

                    <p>
                        The story revolves around the outbreaks of a virus (often called the T-virus), developed by the
                        sinister Umbrella Corporation, which transforms humans into zombies and creates horrific
                        biological weapons. The central characters, including icons like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine,
                        Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, are typically part of law enforcement or special task
                        forces dedicated to investigating and stopping Umbrellaâ€™s biological experiments.

                    <p>
                        The series has expanded beyond video games into films, animated features, novels, and comic
                        books. The original games emphasize survival, limited ammunition, and claustrophobic
                        environments, but later entries, such as Resident Evil 4 and beyond, introduced more
                        action-oriented gameplay while retaining the horror elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Resident Evil franchise has evolved over decades, with numerous sequels, spin-offs, and
                        remakes that cater to both long-time fans and new audiences. Its mix of horror, action,
                        memorable characters, and intricate storylines has cemented it as one of the most influential
                        and successful franchises in gaming history.
